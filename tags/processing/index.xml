      <description>Intro Back in high school, for an AP CS final project, I decided to make a platformer where you can tell the character to jump by yelling. As a learning experience, I chose to write it in Processing, a piece of software that advertises itself as &amp;ldquo;a flexible software sketchbook&amp;rdquo; and separate language, but is actually a library for Java which makes it very easy to work with graphics, audio, and user input.</description>
