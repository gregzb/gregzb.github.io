      <description>Intro In the set cover problem, there exists a universe set U and a set S of subsets of U. The goal is to pick as few items of S as possible such that their union is equal to the set U.
This version of the problem, where we are trying to find the minimum number of elements of S such that their union is equal to S, is NP-hard. In practice, this means that this problem cannot be solved exactly nor verified efficiently.</description>
