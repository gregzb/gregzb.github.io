      <description>We noted that there are many local issues that students have the power to change. Working in a group with 3 other people, we noted that each of us were taking the same class, CSE320, systems fundamentals part 2. This class is one of the most difficult in Stony Brook University with hard material practical both in software engineering and in computer science theory. However, we found that roughly 95% of surveyed students found the homework documents difficult to understand and would have appreciated more information, clarification, and tips.</description>

      <description>This class project tested my ability to write technical instructions for the average user. Specifically, I wrote about how an average user could install Python on their Windows computer. In the workplace, this will smoothly translate to writing comprehensible and clean documentation for both code and products.
