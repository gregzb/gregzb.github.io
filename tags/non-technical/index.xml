      <description>This post should give some ideas about what to expect from this website.
 About The about page will contain information about myself, but may not reflect newest events or changes.
 Blog I enjoy writing about technical topics, especially simple ones that grab my attention for maybe a week at a time. I am hoping to write up at least one post one per month.
 Projects This will be an organized place to list some of my projects, both completed and in progress.</description>
