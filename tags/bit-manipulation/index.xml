      <description>I wrote my first chess engine, which you can find on my GitHub.
I will be writing an updated version soon, but as a placeholder, I will note that writing a chess engine teaches you a treasure trove of information, especially if you are aiming to write a fast one. I will give a small preview of things I have learned and plan to learn:
 I better learned to program in C++, specifically about minimizing my memory and performance footprints.</description>

      <title>Set Cover as Fast as Possible</title>

      <description>Intro In the set cover problem, there exists a universe set U and a set S of subsets of U. The goal is to pick as few items of S as possible such that their union is equal to the set U.
This version of the problem, where we are trying to find the minimum number of elements of S such that their union is equal to S, is NP-hard. In practice, this means that this problem cannot be solved exactly nor verified efficiently.</description>
