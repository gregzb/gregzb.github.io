      <description>This post should give some ideas about what to expect from this website.
 About The about page will contain information about myself, but may not reflect newest events or changes.
 Blog I enjoy writing about technical topics, especially simple ones that grab my attention for maybe a week at a time. I am hoping to write up at least one post one per month.
 Projects This will be an organized place to list some of my projects, both completed and in progress.</description>

Abstract Data structure courses often introduce linked lists as a basic data structure as an alternative to arrays. They supposedly have the advantage of constant time insertion and deletion at any point in the list as long as you have access to a pointer near the node you are inserting or deleting.</description>

      <description>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m a 2nd year student at Stony Brook University double majoring in Computer Science (CSE) and Applied Math and Statistics (AMS).
I&amp;rsquo;m primarily interested in the computer science side of things with math as a supporting factor. Right now, you&amp;rsquo;ll catch me learning about interesting algorithms (pssst scapegoat trees) and the basics of machine learning.
Outside of academics, you may find me exploring campus, walking, and hiking.
 Education  2nd year student at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics (Expected Graduation: May 2024) Relevant Courses: Honors Intro to Theory of Computation, Honors Analysis of Algorithms, Natural Language Processing, Systems Fundamentals I &amp;amp; II, Linear Algebra, Intro to Abstract Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations  Work Experience  Incoming Software Engineering Intern at Citadel (Summer 2022) Software Engineering Intern at Bloomberg L.</description>
