      <description>Hey! I&amp;rsquo;m a 2nd year student at Stony Brook University double majoring in Computer Science (CSE) and Applied Math and Statistics (AMS).
I&amp;rsquo;m primarily interested in the computer science side of things with math as a supporting factor. Right now, you&amp;rsquo;ll catch me learning about interesting algorithms (pssst scapegoat trees) and the basics of machine learning.
Outside of academics, you may find me exploring campus, walking, and hiking.
